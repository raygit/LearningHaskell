-- Let's dissect the monadic instance a little bit...
-- First we pattern match or unpack the 'm a' value of 'IdentityT m a' via the
-- data constructor. Doing this has the type 'IdentityT m a -> m a' ad the type
-- of 'ma' is 'm a'. This nomenclature doesn't mean anything beyond mnemonic
-- signaling, but it is intended to be helpful.
--
-- The type of the bind we are implementing is the following:
--
-- (>>=) :: IdentityT m a -> (a -> IdentityT m b) -> IdentityT m b
-- This is the instance we are defining.
--
-- This is the function we are binding over 'IdentityT m a'. It has the
-- following type: '(a -> IdentityT m b)'.
--
-- Here 'ma' is the same one we unpacked out of the IdentityT data constructor
-- and has the type 'm a'. Removed from its IdentityT context, this is now the
-- 'm a' that this bind takes as its first argument.
--
-- This is a different bind! The first bind is the bind we are trying to
-- implement; this bind is its definition or implementation. We are now using
-- the Monad we asked for in the instance declaration with the constraint
-- 'Monad m =>'. This will have the type:
--
-- (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
-- 
--
instance (Monad m) => Monad (IdentityT m) where
  return :: a -> IdentityT m a
  return = pure
  (>>=) :: IdentityT m a -> (a -> IdentityT m b) -> IdentityT m b
  (IdentityT ma) >>= f = IdentityT $ ma >>= runIdentityT . f


-- We need runIdentityT because f returns IdentityT m b, but the >>= for the
-- Monad m => has the type m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b. It will end up trying to
-- join m (IdentityT m b) , which won't work because m and IdentityT m are not
-- the same type. We use runIdentityT to unpack the value. Doing this has the
-- type IdentityT m b -> m b and the composition runIdentityT . f in tihs
-- context has the type a -> m b. You can use undefined in GHCi to demonstrate
-- this for yourself:
--
-- *Chapter25> let f :: (a -> IdentityT m b); f = undefined
-- *Chapter25> :t f
-- f :: a -> IdentityT m b
-- *Chapter25> :t runIdentityT
-- runIdentityT :: IdentityT f a -> f a
-- *Chapter25> :t (runIdentityT . f)
-- (runIdentityT . f) :: a1 -> f a
-- *Chapter25>
--
--
-- To satisfy the type of the outer bind, we are implementing for the Monad of
-- IdentityT m, which expects a final result of the type IdentityT m b, we must
-- take the m b which the expression ma >>= runIdentityT . f returns and repack
-- it in IdentityT. Note:
--

--

-- f) which the following type : `Compose f g (Compose f g b)` and now i know
-- that `join :: Monad m => m(m a) -> m a` can actually help me flatten it.
-- Therefore, its being applied. See below.

-- Let's understand how the expression was constructed.
-- i want to get to the 'a' value embedded in 'Compose f g a' so i lift 'f'
-- once into 'Compose f g a' and that would return 'Compose f g (ff b)' and
-- then i remembered that sequenceA is really good at flipping contexts
-- so i applied it, last.
