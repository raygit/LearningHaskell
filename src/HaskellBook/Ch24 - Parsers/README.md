# Haskell's parsing ecosystem

Haskell has several excellent parsing libraries available, `parsec` and
`attoparsec` are perhaps the two most well known parser combinator libraries in
Haskell, but there is also `megaparsec` and others. `aeson` and `cassava` are
among the libraries designed for parsing specific types of data (JSON data and
CSV data, respectively).
