-- Notes about associated types versus fundeps
--
-- associated types have some benefits that fundeps don't have:
-- * Associated types provide explicit type functions contrary to the
-- implicit relations of functional dependencies
-- * Type functions allow us to reduce the number of type parameters for a
-- typeclass
-- * Type functions are more idiomatically functional than relational-stype
-- functional dependencies
