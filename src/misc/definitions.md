+ A `tuple`
```
A tuple is an ordered grouping of values. In haskell, there is no 
singleton tuple, but there is a zero tuple also called unit or (). 
The types of elements of tuples are allowed to vary, so you can have
both (String, String) or (Integer, String). Tuples in Haskell are
the usual means of expressing an anonymoud product.
