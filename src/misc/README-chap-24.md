# Parser Combinators

The word "parse" comes from the Latin word for "parts", and means to analyze a
sentence and label the syntactic role, or part of speech of each component.
Language teachers once emphasized this ability because it forced students to think
closely about the structure of sentences, the relationships among the parts, and the
connection between the structure and the meaning of the whole. Diagramming sentences wa 
was also common because it made parsing visual and somewhat concrete. It is now
common to represent grammatical structures of natural languages as trees.
