-- Write the game Morra using StateT and IO. The state being accumulated is the
-- score of theplayer and the computer AI the player is playing against. To
-- start, make the computer choose its play randomly.
-- On exit, report the scores for the player and the computer , congratulating
-- the winner.
--
-- What is this game? Looking up the wikipedia reveals this explanation :
--
-- > Morra is a hand game that dates back thousands of years to ancient Roman and
-- > Greek times. Each player simultaneously reveals their hand, extending any
-- > number of fingers, and calls out a number. Any player who successfully
-- > guesses the total number of fingers revealed by all players combined scores a point.
--
-- Add a human vs. human mode to the game with interstitial screens between
-- input prompts so the players can change out of the hotseat without seeing
-- the other player's answer.
--
-- Improve the computer AI slightly by making it remember 3-grams of the
-- players behavior, adjusting its answer instead of deciding randomly when the
-- player's behavior matches a known behavior.
--

-- 
-- The purpose of designing this game is really to exercise my familiarity with
-- the Monad Transformers with the end goal of gaining proficieny and like any programming journey
-- the important thing to keep in focus is to practice ... practice .. practice
-- and keep practicing till the crux is revealed. How do i know its been
-- revealed ? Its simple : if i can explain why the code works and convince
-- myself thoroughly then i can truly say that i have completely understood the
-- program.
