-- Creating a Monad Transformer
-- To turn out new swanky type up there â†‘ , we must provide an instance of the
-- MonadTrans class so that a user can access the underlying monad
--

-- Tip: The trick to understanding the body of the implementation is that
-- everything inside the "do" block executes in the underlying monad m,
-- whatever that is:
