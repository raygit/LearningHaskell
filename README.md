LearningHaskell
===============

This is my journey for learning Haskell and adopting 
it to my style of writing programs in Scala. I draw
inspirations from the book "Real World Haskell" by 
Don Stewart, Bryan'o Sullivan and John Goerzen

Environment
================
- Haskell Platform for OSX 

```
Raymonds-MacBook-Pro:LearningHaskell raymondtay$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.8.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude>
Leaving GHCi.
```

Source Code

Mostly from the book in their original form, if there are 
others, i'll indicate them as we move along
