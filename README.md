LearningHaskell
===============

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey into the
programming language, `Haskell`. The organization was originally based on the
code examples from the book [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
but that organization has since changed as i read more, i learnt more.

I am afraid to say this but the organization is probably more understandable to
me than anyone else. However, there's a structure to it.

Environment
================

The code examples here mostly work for GHC versions 7.8.3, 8.6.5 and 8.8.3

- I'm using the [Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) for macOS 

Organization
===============

The organization started around the RWH code examples and i've organized them
in such a way that :

At the __top-level__ directory i.e. `src`

* You will see various directories and they can be categorized into two things:
  * Named after books i've read or reading
  * Interesting topics i found which is not a book e.g. `Yesod` 
* When you see a directory prefix that starts with digits, e.g. `01_...`, it
  correlates with the chapter in the RWH [book](https://book.realworldhaskell.org)
